<p>I'm currently in the Honours Bachelor of Applied Computer Science programming at Sheridan College specializing in the field of mobile computing. When I'm away from code, you can find me watching, reading, playing, and breathing baseball. I watch more baseball than what is considered healthy, and do some <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6a5_um5Gvs8">Olympic weightlifting</a> to do something that is actually considered healthy. </p>

<a id="work-experience" class="anchor" href="#work-experience" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Work Experience</h3>

<p>I've had the opportunity to work as a programmer/developer at Sheridan College on a project funded by the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council (NSERC) and Encore Marketing Management. Under the leadership of <a href="http://www-acad.sheridanc.on.ca/~sykes/short_bio.html">Dr. Edward Sykes</a>, our team's goal is to help sales representatives answer questions for products on store shelves to increase their productivity. The use of mobile devices will help them do so: 
  <ul> 
    <li> Sales rep goes to a store and take a picture of a store shelf with an iPad camera <img src="images/juiceShelf.jpg" style="width:640px;height:480px;"></li> 
    <li> Computer vision algorithm recognizes an object of interest </li>
    <li> A bounding box surround an object of interest producing a touch point on the iPad</li>
    <li> Sales rep touches the touch point and answers questions <img src="images/boundingBox.png" style="width:640px;height:206px;"> </li> 
  </ul>
 To develop an object detector to detect the object, we are using the <a href="https://www.mathworks.com/help/vision/"> MATLAB computer vision toolbox </a> to recognize products of interest on a store shelf. We've been using the Viola-Jones algorithm to develop object detectors for many products of interest. We've been able to detect juice boxes on store shelves and so far it has been a success. </br> <img src="images/imageDetected.png" style="width:348px;height:480px;"> </br> The next stage is to build the iPad app that connects to a cloud-based service so a sales rep can use it in the field. We presented this project to the Sheridan Mobile Computing Symposium and won the <a href="https://www.sheridancollege.ca/news-and-events/news/sheridan-hosts-inaugural-mobile-computing-symposium.aspx">grand prize for student creativity and innovation.</a></p>
