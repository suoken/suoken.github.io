<img src="images/me.png"> </a>
<p>I'm currently in the Honours Bachelor of Applied Computer Science program at Sheridan College specializing in the field of mobile computing. Nothing gets me going than the rush of solving a problem. I like the feeling in your stomach when something is bothering you, and I love the feeling of relief that you get when you finally solve the problem. We are quickly moving away from desktop platform to mobile platforms and I want to be a leader in developing mobile applications that can help society. So that's why I'm specializing in mobile computing because I want to problems that can be solved using mobile computing. </p>

<p> When I'm away from code, you can find me watching videos about cars and reading about new technologies developed for cars. My favourite car of all time is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ferrari_250_GTO"> 1964 Ferrari 250 GTO. </a>I also like watching, reading, playing, and breathing anything baseball. I love anaylizing baseball stats, talking with baseball nerds, and I read <a href="http://www.fangraphs.com/"> Fangraphs </a> pretty much every day even in the off-season. I watch more baseball than what is considered healthy, and do some <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6a5_um5Gvs8">Olympic weightlifting</a> to do something that is actually considered healthy. </p>

<a id="work-experience" class="anchor" href="#work-experience" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Work Experience</h3>

<p>I've had the opportunity to work as a programmer/developer at Sheridan College on a project funded by the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council (NSERC) and Encore Marketing Management. Under the leadership of <a href="http://www-acad.sheridanc.on.ca/~sykes/short_bio.html">Dr. Edward Sykes</a>, our team's goal is to help sales representatives answer questions for products on store shelves to increase their productivity. The use of mobile devices will help them do so: 
  <ul> 
    <li> Sales rep goes to a store and take a picture of a store shelf with an iPad camera <img src="images/juiceShelf.jpg" style="width:640px;height:480px;"></li> 
    <li> Computer vision algorithm builds an object detector to recognize an object of interest <a href="https://www.mathworks.com/help/vision/ug/train-a-cascade-object-detector.html"> <img src="images/objectDetectorSteps.png" style="width:640px;height:137px"></a> </li>
    <li> A bounding box surround an object of interest producing a touch point on the iPad</li>
    <li> Sales rep touches the touch point and answers questions <img src="images/boundingBox.png" style="width:640px;height:206px;"> </li> 
  </ul>
 To develop an object detector to detect the object, we are using the <a href="https://www.mathworks.com/help/vision/"> MATLAB computer vision toolbox </a> to recognize products of interest on a store shelf. We've been using the Viola-Jones algorithm to develop object detectors for many products of interest. We've been able to detect juice boxes on store shelves and so far it has been a success. </br> <img src="images/imageDetected.png" style="width:348px;height:480px;"> </br> The next stage is to build the iPad app that connects to a cloud-based service so a sales rep can use it in the field. We presented this project to the Sheridan Mobile Computing Symposium and won the <a href="https://www.sheridancollege.ca/news-and-events/news/sheridan-hosts-inaugural-mobile-computing-symposium.aspx">grand prize for student creativity and innovation</a> and won a cool $2500 between the three of us.</p>

<p>I've taken courses in mobile application development in Android and iOS envionments. Class projects involved me to build quiz applications and tip calculators. </p>

<p>I'm working on a few personal project right now </p>
