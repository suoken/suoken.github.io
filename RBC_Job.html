<p>I can't go into too much detail due to non-disclosure agreements between me an the bank, so I will try to let you know as much as I can about my role as a Co-op Junior Research Developer at RBC. </p> 
<p> I worked in the innovation Department at RBC and during my first month there, I was assigned to make a proof-of-concept Android mobile application that used the <a href="https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/wiki/Mobile:-Introduction">Go-Ethereum (Geth) Library</a> that can be used by RBC employees. A node would be created on the Android application with the users account name stored on client-side database. The node would attach to a private Ethereum blockchain that was hosted on Microsoft Azure using their Ethereum Blockchain as a Service. I used Java and Android Studio to make the Android application. </p>

<p>The next month, I worked in an Agile team to assemble a web application in Django. The web application was a auto finance application that is designed to help dealerships sell more cars to customers. Vauge? I know, it's under NDA. Anyway, I used Python, the Django web framework, and PostgreSQL for database management. I attended Scrum meetings and was assigned issues to solve on the project. Project production was also part of the DevOps pipeline which I used for the first time. Work was submitted to GitHub and Jenkins for CI/CD.</p>
