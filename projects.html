			<p><a href="https://devpost.com/software/alphanote">AlphaNote</a>: Built during Local Hack Day 2017. Won 3rd place overall. Wolfram Alpha can solve and graph math equations, and has a large amount of data on chemistry, physics, biology, etc. We thought it was a good idea to make an app using the Wolfram Alpha API where you could take notes (in a text editor) and have Wolfram search up keywords or graph math equations because it is usually rather hard to type up math notes and chemistry notes. When a word is placed is square brackets, it searches that word in Wolfram Alpha and returns an image based on that word (eg. type benzene, and return a benzene image). </p>

			<p><a href="https://github.com/JelaniThompson/DevCircleTorontoHackathon">Clothes Recognition with Facebook Messenger</a>: Built during the Messenger Bots 2017 Hackathon hosted by Facebook Developer Circles in Toronto.
			The Facebook messenger app analyzes clothing items (using DeepFashion API) in a picture and attempts to find that item in a store's inventory that uses Shopify.
			Why? Many customers come to a store and ask employees if they have a certain article of clothing that they found online and employees attempt to find what they are looking for in their inventory. We made a bot that does that work instead. It analyzes a picture, recognizes the clothes in the picture, and recommend clothes from the store's inventory that look similar to it.</p>

			<p><a href="https://github.com/suoken/ETHWaterloo-binary-betting">Binary Betting Application</a>: Built during the EthWaterloo Hackathon. Binary betting application on assets. A user predicts that an asset will go up or down in value on a certain date and/or time. If they are correct, they recieve an award. Those bets and award payout are recorded and on the Ethereum blockchain.</p>

			<p><a href="https://devpost.com/software/readar-pkqi1l">ReadAR</a>: For HackHarvard 2017 Hackathon. Allows kids to have fun while reading out loud. Children read a piece of text from a story, their voice is analyzed using Google Cloud Speech API, and when they get it right, an augmented reality mask is placed over their face. </p>

			<p><b>20/20</b>: For RBC Next Great Innovator Hackathon, our team tried to develop a solution that would convince co-op students to come work at RBC and sort students with managers that actually give co-op students meaningful work so that way they can make an impact in a large organization. We implemented a "draft system" where managers that have good performance reviews and have "impactful work" would be paired up with students who show high performance. Students would choose areas of work they are interested in (machine learning, blockchain, big data, UI/UX) and then be paired with a good manager in the field. It promoted gamification for managers so that way they perform better.</p>

			<p><a href="https://github.com/suoken/GM-preferences">GM Preferences</a>: Hackathon project using the GM Infotainment System that would determine the user preferences and adjust the car settings according to user settings. The idea was devised as a solution when shared automous cars becomes ubiquitous in the future. Cars loose personality and everyone has different settings that they prefer. With our application, the user would tap their phone to an NFC tag, and their preferences would be adjusted in the car automatically. </p>

			<p><a href="https://github.com/suoken/see-a-day-give-a-day">See a Day, Give a Day</a>: This project was for the United Way #Create4Community hackathon - a hackathon for the United Way whose mission statement is to find unique solutions to engage 1 million individuals in the GTA to be involved in community engagement and giving. See a Day, Give a Day is a WebVR application that assist in telling the stories of 200 community hubs across the GTA. Our team recognized that each community hub has a unique story that everyone does not know about and our team wanted to improve that story telling aspect by producing a VR application. We made a WebVR application because we wanted these stories to be experienced on the desktop or through mobile phone with the simple click of a link. This WebVR app would be part of the United Way campaign toolkit and would help 1 million people in the GTA empathize with the stories told through VR and then they would donate money to the United Way or donate their time by volunteering with the United Way (See a Day, Give a Day). Won the Trailblazers Award for most innovative project.</p>

			<p><a href="https://github.com/suoken/teamcc">Cue And Cope</a>: This project was for DementiaHack - a hackathon to create life-improving hardware and software solutions for those living with dementia and their caregivers. Cue and Cope is an application built using WebRTC and React that helps caregivers and loved ones talk to a person with dementia using a mobile device. Our team identified that loneliness and social isolation was a common problem with people living with dementia and our solution was to make an application that helps with communication between loved ones and a person with dementia. Our idea was to make a tablet that had no user interaction from the person with dementia because we want to make an application that was very simple to use so our idea was to have the tablet fixed to a wall where the person with dementia lives and the tablet would play video recordings from loved ones, play reminders through videos, and interact with their loved ones through real time communication. If a person with dementia routinely forgets an activity, the video reminder would loop every 5 minutes telling them of the activity. </p>
